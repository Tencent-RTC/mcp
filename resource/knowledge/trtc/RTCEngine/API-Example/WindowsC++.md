This document describes how to quickly run the demo for the TRTC Windows SDK. 

## Prerequisites
- Install Visual Studio 2017 or later (v2019 is recommended).

- Install [Qt 5.14.x](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/).

- Find the right version of Qt Add-in for your Visual Studio on the [Qt website](https://download.qt.io/development_releases/vsaddin/). Download and install it.

- Open Visual Studio, in the menu bar, select **Extension > QT VS Tools > Qt Options > Qt Versions**, and add a **MSVC compiler**.

- Copy all the DLL files in `SDK/CPlusPlus/Win64/lib` (for 64-bit Windows) to the `debug/release` folder of the project directory.

   > **Note：**
   > 
   > `debug/release` is auto-generated after environment configuration in Visual Studio. For 32-bit Windows, copy all the DLL files in `SDK/CPlusPlus/Win32/lib to the debug/release` folder of the project directory.

## Steps To Run Demo

### Step 1. Download the Demo

Download the [TRTC_Windows-C++](https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TRTC_Windows) sample demo code on github which SDK has been imported into, or run the following command in a terminal:
``` bash
git clone 
```

### Step 2. Configure the Demo
1. Log in to the [TRTC Console](https://console.trtc.io/) and click **Create Application**. If you have already done so, you may skip this step.

2. And then, your own `SDKAppID` and `SDKSecretKey` of your created application can be obtained in the **Basic Information** section.

   

3. Replace the values of `SDKAPPID` and `SDKSECRETKEY` in `defs.h` file under `TRTC-API-Example-C++`/`TRTC-API-Example-Qt`/`src`/`Util` directory with the information obtained in **Step 2** .

   

   > **Note：**
   > 
   > - In the demo above, we used **SDKSecretKey** to generate **UserSig** locally in order to help you go through the demo easier. However, in the production environment, you are not supposed to generate userSig in this way, which may lead to **SDKSecretKey** leakage, thereby creating a chance for attackers to steal your TRTC traffic. **The correct way to generate UserSig is to integrate** [**Server-Side Generation of UserSig**](https://trtc.io/document/35166) **on your server.** When an user enters the room:
   > - Send a http request to your server.
   > - Generate a UserSig on your server.
   > - Return it to the user to enter the room.
   > - When you deploy your page to a production environment, you need to have your page accessed through the HTTPS(e.g. `https://domain/xxx`). For the reason, please refer to the document [Page Access Protocol Restriction Description](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/webrtc/v5/doc/en/tutorial-05-info-browser.html#h2-3).

### Step 3. Run the Demo

Open `QTDemo.sln` in the TRTC-API-Example-Qt directory with Microsoft Visual Studio (v2019 is recommended), set up the Qt environment (Qt 5.14 is recommended), and run the project.
